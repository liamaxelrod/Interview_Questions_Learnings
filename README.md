# 1. Interview Questions Learnings

A repository for storing, solving, and reflecting on coding interview problems across multiple programming languages.  

This repo serves two main purposes:  
1. To **practice and master** common interview coding problems.  
2. To **document learnings and reflections**, showing growth and understanding over time.

## 2. Project Description

This project is my **personal archive of coding interview questions and solutions**, solved in different programming languages.  

- Each problem includes **multiple language solutions** where possible (e.g., JavaScript, Java, HTML/CSS, etc.).  
- Each folder contains a **README.md reflection** explaining what I learned from solving the problem, common pitfalls, and insights for the future.  
- The goal is to not just collect solutions, but also to **showcase my understanding and learning process**.

## 3. Live Demo and/or Screenshots

A live demo has not been published yet.  
Future plan: connect this repo to a simple static website (via GitHub Pages) to make solutions easily browsable.

## 5. How to Run Locally

To view or run solutions:  

1. **Clone the repository** from GitHub.  
2. **Navigate into a problem folder**, e.g. `problems/arrays/two_sum/`.  
3. Open the relevant file(s) in your editor:  
   - `.js` → run with Node.js (`node solution.js`).  
   - `.java` → compile and run (`javac solution.java && java Solution`).  
   - `.html/.css` → open directly in your browser.  
4. Follow additional instructions in `docs/HOW_TO_RUN.md`.

## 6. Lessons Learned

This repo isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about **growing as a problem solver**.  

For each problem, I’ll reflect on:  
- What the problem taught me.  
- Mistakes I made and how I fixed them.  
- Patterns I recognized (useful for future problems).  
- How different languages solve the same challenge.  

---

## 7. Future Improvements

- Add a static site (via GitHub Pages) to browse problems.  
- Add Python and other languages as I learn them.  
- Tag problems by category and difficulty.  
- Include performance analysis (time/space complexity).  

---

## 8. Links / Acknowledgments

- Inspired by common coding interview prep resources (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.).  
- Documentation & structure assisted by **ChatGPT** and **Copilot**.  
- Future notes may reference external tutorials or problem explanations.
