Prompt: Interview Question Assistance

Interview Question Assistance Prompt Context: I am currently working on one of the coding interview questions from my “Interview Questions Learnings” project. Purpose: I may ask you for guidance, hints, or advice related to: Problem understanding or clarification Solution approach or strategy Code implementation or debugging Best practices for solving similar problems Instructions for AI: Provide clear, step-by-step guidance without giving away the full solution unless explicitly requested. Offer explanations that improve understanding of the problem and coding concepts. Suggest resources or references if relevant. Keep the focus on learning, problem-solving, and skill improvement.

The problem we're going to work on is Link:
??? https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-the-bracket-pairs-of-a-string/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=v9ut1ir1

Remember, don't say anything until I ask And even when I ask, don't give me a solution, give me a path so I can learn.
